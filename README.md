## Catastrophe Risk Analytics for Insurance
This project applies catastrophe risk analytics and a Random Forest model to address insurers’ exposure to highly variable, geographically concentrated, and heavy-tailed disaster risks. 

By integrating severity, frequency, and spatial concentration metrics across hazards such as floods, droughts, and earthquakes, it improves underwriting, pricing, retention, and reinsurance decisions. The approach enhances predictive accuracy, identifies high-severity risk zones and regional accumulations, and supports more resilient, well-priced insurance portfolios and regulatory compliance.
